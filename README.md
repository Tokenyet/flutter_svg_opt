# Flutter Svg Opt

A command-line tool which help flutter_svg to reorder **<defs>** on right order.

**Notice: you might want to backup all svgs to prevent any corruptions...**

  
Because of the [issue](https://github.com/dnfield/flutter_svg/issues/102). Here is the basic example: use `flutter_svg_opt` as dev dependency, and run `flutter pub run flutter_svg_opt:main` (will change all svgs under assets by default).
